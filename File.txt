The defect in the given pseudocode lies in how it handles whitespace.

The pseudocode only reverses the characters of string s, but it does not
handle whitespace. This means that if the input string s contains whitespace
characters, they won't be properly handled during the comparison. As a result,
the function may incorrectly classify strings with whitespace as non-palindromes.

To fix this defect, the pseudocode should handle whitespace characters properly before
comparing the reversed string with the original string. Typically, when checking for palindromes,
whitespace characters are ignored during the comparison.
